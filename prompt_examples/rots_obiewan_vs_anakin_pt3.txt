moment - of sorrow and despair, resting in the liv-
ing Force as he had been trained to do, Obi-Wan
Kenobi looked at his former friend and student, and
did the unexpected. He made a soaring leap into the
air and landed on the high bank of the lava river.
"It's over, Anakin," he said, looking down, "I have
the high ground. Don't try it."
"You underestimate the power of the dark side!"
Anakin shot back, and with the last word, he jumped.
And Obi-Wan's lightsaber moved, slicing through
Anakin's knees and then coming up to take his
remaining hand. Anakin's lightsaber fell at Obi-
Wan's feet. What was left of Anakin fell on the
burning black sand almost at the edge of the lava.
Anakin - no, Obi-Wan reminded himself, not
Anakin. Darth Vader. Darth Vader scrabbled at the
sand with his metal arm, trying to pull himself away
from the lava river. Obi-Wan looked down at the
maimed body, and at last felt tears sting his eyes.
"You were the Chosen One," he said, not to Darth
Vader, but to his dead friend Anakin, the man whose
spirit Darth Vader had murdered. "You were sup-
posed to destroy the Sith, not join them. You were to
bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness."
He swallowed hard. He couldn't see the body
through his tears; he could barely make out the shine
of Anakin's lightsaber on the ground at his feet.
"I hate you!" Vader screamed.
