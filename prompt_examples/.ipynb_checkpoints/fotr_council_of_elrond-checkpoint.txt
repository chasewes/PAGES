No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke.
Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to
him. All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep
thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the
pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and
vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo’s side in
Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke,
and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will
was using his small voice.
‘I will take the Ring,’ he said, ‘though I do not know the
way.’

Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt
his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. ‘If I
understand aright all that I have heard,’ he said, ‘I think that
this task is appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not
find a way, no one will. This is the hour of the Shire-folk,
when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers
and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have
foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect to
know it, until the hour has struck?
‘But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it
on another. I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I
will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty
Elf-friends of old, Hador, and Hu´rin, and Tu´rin, and Beren
himself were assembled together, your seat should be among
them.’
‘But you won’t send him off alone surely, Master?’ cried
Sam, unable to contain himself any longer, and jumping up
from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the
floor.
‘No indeed!’ said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile.
‘You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate
you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council
and you are not.’
Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. ‘A nice pickle we
have landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!’ he said, shaking his
head.
