ground his teeth in frustrated anger. Part of him
wanted to turn on his heel and leave what was left of
Darth Vader to burn to ashes in the rising lava. Even
if he was alive, even if he could be saved, Vader
would be crippled.
And not just with his mechanical limbs. The
Force - dark side as well as light - was generated
by living beings, and it took living flesh to manipu-

Force lightning; that required living hands, not metal
ones. And with so much of his body replaced by

diminished, Darth Vader would still be very strong,
and there were no Jedi left to challenge him. Darth
Sidious had seen to that himself. So he kept walking
until he could bend over the body. And to his sur-
prise, his apprentice was still alive.
